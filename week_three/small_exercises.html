        <h2>Or rant about whatever grinds your gears</h2>
        <h3>Like that Jeremy guy, for example</h3>
        <h4>I mean, like what is his deal?</h4>
        <h5>Why does he drink so much Coke Zero? Weird...</h5>

        <p>Here's what I like about lists:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
        <li>That's about it</li>
        <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When you make a list, do it in this order:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
            <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</li>
                </ul>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
                        </ol>
            <li>You've got this, I believe you!</li>
        </ol>
